# Python-Tables

Hello!

I am Kalp Amin.

I have made this project :

1. To get used to using GitHub (This is my first project on GitHub)
2. To help people access tables of numbers rapidly and in a user-friendly, voice-assistant-like style interface.

Note : To run this project properly, you will need to import the modules SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3.
